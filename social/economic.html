	    <h2>Income Spent on <strong>Housing</strong> in Rockford</h2>

	    <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
	    <p>Housing is the <strong>single biggest expense</strong> for the vast majority of Americans.
		<br><br>
	    The role housing plays in overall health is obvious when one considers the physical harm that can come from not having a dry, temperature controlled, safe place to stay. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    Less obvious is the role housing has on mental wellbeing. When it is harder to find or afford housing, it is harder to leave an abuser, leave a problematic home life, or many other situations. Threat of homelessness and the financial burden of housing weigh heavy on mental wellbeing. 
	    <br><br>
	    The graph to the left shows the distribution each income bracket spends on housing as a percentage of their income. Notable are the fact that almost all of the poorest households, those in the 0-$20k annual income range, spend over 50% of their income on housing. Considering that Housing Authorities are prohibited from charging more than 30% of a resident's income for housing and are meant to provide housing for these low-income individuals, it appears there is a severe lack of public housing available.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    Additionally, the poorest residents often obtain housing by renting off landlords. This means the money they spend on housing does not go toward making them wealthier the same way a homeowner with a mortgage does. This graph does not capture the amount of renters vs homeowners, but other graphs on the page about <a href="../social/community.html">Community Context</a> and the page about <a href="../social/built.html">Built Environment</a> do.

	    <p>This graph divides the population of Winnebago County by where their income falls relative to the poverty line. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    Between 2015 and 2019 there was substantial growth in those earning between 0 and 50% of the poverty line as well as those earning between 50% and 200%.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    Over the same time period, there was a growth in those earning more than 500% of the poverty line. This matches a trend across the United States in which the middle class shrinks while the poorest and riches grow.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    Noteworthy is that data for 2020, the first year drastically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, are not yet available. Because there was an existing trend in a growing poor population, is it likely that this was exaccerbated as many lost their jobs due to the pandemic.

	    <p>This chart shows the same information as the one above but divides the population into narrower brackets and displays all of the years between 2015 and 2019. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    Year to year, there is considerable variation in most of the brackets with much of the variation being in those earning less than 150% of the poverty line. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    The same trend of a shrinking middle class and growin poor and rich classes can be seen.
