	    <p>Disconnected Youth are people between the ages of 16 and 19 who are not in school, training, or employed. This graph displays the percentage of all youth aage 16-19 which are disconnected.
		<br><br>
	    There has been much emphasis placed on this group as they representan age where decisions have a cascading and lifelong impact. Without education or training it is hard to get a job. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/chart-unemployment-earnings-education.htm" target="_bla">Rates of unemployment are significantly higher among those with less education</a> and with that comes lack of housing stability, mental health issues, physical health, and many other problems.

	    <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
	    <p>Homeownership rate is the percentage of households (families or individuals or other living arrangements) that own the home they live in outright or have a mortage on the home they live in. 
	    <br><br>
	    High homeownership rates are benecifical to a community as they represent stable, long-term commitment by residents to their community. Compared to renters they are less likely to move, compared to landlords they are more likely to make improvements and keep their home in good condition, and the money they spend on housing does not go outside the community to a landlord company.
	    <br>
	   	<br>
	   	Homes also represent a source of wealth for their owners which typically acrues value over time. In communities with low rates of homeownership, this value does not go directly to the residents of the community.

	    <h2><strong>Mean Commuting Time</strong></h2>

	  </div>
	  <div class="column third">
	    <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
	    <p>Mean commuting time is the average number of minutes it takes commuters to get to their job. 
	    <br><br>
	    <a href="https://www.remoteyear.com/blog/commute-negative-side-effects" target="_blank">The mental toll of commutes is well documented</a> with commuting time being linked to levels of loneliness, stress, depression, and overall bad mental health.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    Long commuting times also indicate a lack of affordable housing in areas with jobs. For many, there is typically an addage of "drive until you can afford it" for housing. Meaning that one starts where there job is--typically in a city center--and they drive out until the housing becomes affordable. This increases the overall cost of living and cost of having a job as it requires car ownership and increases wear and tear on the vehicle as well as gas. A high or rising mean commuting time may well be a portent of future problems or an indicator of current problems.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    Commutes also represent a lack of free-time. A 20 minute commute equates to over 3 hours each week which can not be spent with family, children, friends, doing housework, or anything productive.
