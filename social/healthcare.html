	    The number of people per primary healthcare provider can give a rough view of how accessible healthcare can be to the general public. Though a low number of people per primary care providers is good, it does not communicate how many people in an area have a primary care provider or can afford one.

	    Dental care or <strong>Oral Healthcare</strong> is often overlooked in discussions of health care. Regular dental care is important in preventing larger tooth or mouth related problems from developing.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    Oral disease can cause chronic pain or infections that can cause further problems with eating, speaking, and learning. Bad oral health also has a massive impact on employment.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/fast-facts/index.html" target="_blank">Fifty percent of children have had at least one cavity by the time they turn 8</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/fast-facts/index.html" target="_blank">around 1 in 4 Americans currently has a cavity</a>.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    Oral health, similar to most healthcare, is often said to "charge interest". Small oral health problems which go untreated turn into major and much more costly oral health problems. Those without ready access to affordable and frequent oral healthcare due to the cost can end up paying more if their problems turn into larger ones. This creates a trap of sorts, where those unable to pay for regualr oral care end up with major problems which further fiancnially burden them.

	    Mental Health Providers come in many forms though most are <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/substance-abuse-behavioral-disorder-and-mental-health-counselors.htm" target="_blank">Mental Health Counselors</a>, known commonly as therapists. These are the person one would see weekly for a hour-long session. Mental Health Providers also include Psychologists who mainly administer tests and Psychiatrists who are medical doctors specializing in mental health. 
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    A full-time workload for a counselor is between 20 and 25 clients and there are typically 10 to 20 counselors per psychologist or psychiatrist. Because of the higher frequency of personal meetings that mental healthcare requires, the ratio of people per provider is much lower than primary care doctors or dentists (who may see most of their patients once or twice a year).

	    Insurance is the primary way in which Americans receive healthcare of any kind. It is a requirement that all American citizens be insured tho many still remain unable to get health insurance due to financial cost or other factors.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    A lack of health insurance makes healthcare in the United States, which is already quite expensive, even more expensive. Because the uninsured are often poor, this makes healthcare even more inaccessible.

	    <p>
	    	<strong>Unnecessary ER Visits</strong> are a sign that the primary healthcare system for a community is lacking. Without access to a primary care provider, individuals often do not know if their medical problem is serious enough to warrant and ER visit.
	    	<br>
	    	<br>
	    	A low number of Unnecessary ER Visits may indicate a more accessible healthcare network, or one in which people fear going to a hospital for financial reasons. 
	    	<br>
	    	<br>
	    	As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, people have become more aware of the limited capacity of emergency health services. It is in a communities beest interest to lessen the number of Unnecessary ER Visits as much as possible so hospitals do not become over burdened, wait times are not increased, and care can be given to those who need it most. Additionally, ER visists are one of the most costly forms of heatlh care for patients, the healthcare system, and the public.
